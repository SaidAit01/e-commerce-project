Unavailable slots/events\n * always appear after available ones.\n *\n * ## Availability calculation\n *\n * Wix Bookings calculates availability differently for appointment-based\n * services and classes.\n *\n * ### Appointment availability\n *\n * An appointment slot is `bookable` if:\n * - The slot's `startDate` is later than or equal to `query.filter.startDate`.\n * - The slot's `endDate` is before or equal to `query.filter.endDate`.\n * - The service's `onlineBooking.enabled` is `true`.\n * - The service's early/late booking policies are either not enabled or the\n *   current time is within the defined limits.\n *\n * ### Class event availability\n *\n * A class event is `bookable` if:\n * - The event's `startDate` is later than or equal to `query.filter.startDate`.\n * - The event's `endDate` is before or equal to `query.filter.endDate`.\n * - The event's `remainingCapacity` is greater than `0`.\n * - The service's `onlineBooking.enabled` is `true`.\n * - The service's early/late booking policies are either not enabled or the\n *   current time is within the defined limits.\n *\n * If you want to restrict returned class events to those with a minimum number\n * of remaining spots, specify `openSpots` in the filter. By default, all class\n * events, even those with no open spot, are returned.\n *\n * ## Daylight Savings Time (DST)\n *\n * Due to DST, some local times may not exist or may occur twice. For example,\n * in Santiago, Chile, on September 7, 2025, 0:05 AM doesn't exist because the\n * clock advances from 0:00 AM to 1:00 AM.\n *\n * *Query Availability* automatically adjusts for these gaps. Non-existent times\n * are moved forward by 1 hour, while existing times remain unchanged. For\n * instance, if you call *Query Availability* with a `startDate` of\n * `2025-09-07T00:00:01.000` and an `endDate` of `2025-09-08T00:00:02.000`, the\n * adjusted query will use `2025-09-07T01:00:01.000` as the new start time.\n * @param query - Query options.

For example,  specifying `{\"slotsPerDay\": 3}` returns\n * a maximum of 3 appointment slots/class events for each day that's within the query\n * filter's date range.\n *\n * ## Unavailable slots\n *\n * By default, both available and unavailable appointment slots/ class events\n * are returned. To retrieve only available slots/events, specify\n * `{\"bookable\": true}` in the filter.\n *\n * ## Sorting\n *\n * Slots/events can be sorted only by `startDate`. Unavailable slots/events\n * always appear after available ones.\n *\n * ## Availability calculation\n *\n * Wix Bookings calculates availability differently for appointment-based\n * services and classes.\n *\n * ### Appointment availability\n *\n * An appointment slot is `bookable` if:\n * - The slot's `startDate` is later than or equal to `query.filter.startDate`.\n * - The slot's `endDate` is before or equal to `query.filter.endDate`.\n * - The service's `onlineBooking.enabled` is `true`.\n * - The service's early/late booking policies are either not enabled or the\n *   current time is within the defined limits.\n *\n * ### Class event availability\n *\n * A class event is `bookable` if:\n * - The event's `startDate` is later than or equal to `query.filter.startDate`.\n * - The event's `endDate` is before or equal to `query.filter.endDate`.\n * - The event's `remainingCapacity` is greater than `0`.\n * - The service's `onlineBooking.enabled` is `true`.\n * - The service's early/late booking policies are either not enabled or the\n *   current time is within the defined limits.\n *\n * If you want to restrict returned class events to those with a minimum number\n * of remaining spots, specify `openSpots` in the filter. By default, all class\n * events, even those with no open spot, are returned.\n *\n * ## Daylight Savings Time (DST)\n *\n * Due to DST, some local times may not exist or may occur twice. For example,\n * in Santiago, Chile, on September 7, 2025, 0:05 AM doesn't exist because the\n * clock advances from 0:00 AM to 1:00 AM.\n *\n * *Query Availability* automatically adjusts for these gaps. Non-existent times\n * are moved forward by 1 hour, while existing times remain unchanged. For\n * instance, if you call *Query Availability* with a `startDate` of\n * `2025-09-07T00:00:01.000` and an `endDate` of `2025-09-08T00:00:02.000`, the\n * adjusted query will use `2025-09-07T01:00:01.000` as the new start time.\n */\nexport function queryAvailability(payload: object): RequestOptionsFactory<any> {\n  function __queryAvailability({ host }: any) {\n    const metadata = {\n      entityFqdn: 'wix.bookings.availability.v1.slot_availability',\n      method: 'POST' as any,\n      methodFqn:\n        'com.wixpress.bookings.availability.AvailabilityCalendar.QueryAvailability',\n      packageName: PACKAGE_NAME,\n      url: resolveComWixpressBookingsAvailabilityAvailabilityCalendarUrl({\n        protoPath: '/v1/availability/query',\n        data: payload,\n        host,\n      }),\n      data: payload,\n    };\n\n    return metadata;\n  }\n\n  return __queryAvailability;\n}\n\n/**\n * Returns availability for a given schedule ID\n * The availability for a course is calculated by:\n * - Checking for total spots by the schedule's capacity\n * - Checking for open spots by subtracting the current number of participants from the total spots\n * current number of participants is calculated by summing the number of participants of all bookings booked to the schedule\n * @deprecated\n */\nexport function getScheduleAvailability(\n  payload: object\n): RequestOptionsFactory<any> {\n  function __getScheduleAvailability({ host }: any) {\n    const metadata = {\n      entityFqdn: 'wix.bookings.availability.v1.slot_availability',\n      method: 'GET' as any,\n      methodFqn:\n        'com.wixpress.bookings.availability.AvailabilityCalendar.GetScheduleAvailability',\n      packageName: PACKAGE_NAME,\n      url: resolveComWixpressBookingsAvailabilityAvailabilityCalendarUrl({\n        protoPath: '/v2/availability/schedule/{scheduleId}',\n        data: payload,\n        host,\n      }),\n      params: toURLSearchParams(payload),\n    };\n\n    return metadata;\n  }\n\n  return __getScheduleAvailability;\n}\n\nexport function calculateMultiSlotAvailability(\n  payload: object\n): RequestOptionsFactory<any> {\n  function __calculateMultiSlotAvailability({ host }: any) {\n    const metadata = {\n      entityFqdn: 'wix.bookings.availability.v1.slot_availability',\n      method: 'POST' as any,\n      methodFqn:\n        'com.wixpress.bookings.availability.AvailabilityCalendar.CalculateMultiSlotAvailability',\n      packageName: PACKAGE_NAME,\n      url: resolveComWixpressBookingsAvailabilityAvailabilityCalendarUrl({\n        protoPath: '/v1/availability/multislot',\n        data: payload,\n        host,\n      }),\n      data: payload,\n    };\n\n    return metadata;\n  }\n\n  return __calculateMultiSlotAvailability;\n}\n","import { HttpClient, NonNullablePaths } from '@wix/sdk-types';\nimport {\n  CalculateMultiSlotAvailabilityOptions,\n  CalculateMultiSlotAvailabilityResponse,\n  GetScheduleAvailabilityApplicationErrors,\n  GetScheduleAvailabilityResponse,\n  QueryAvailabilityOptions,\n  QueryAvailabilityResponse,\n  QueryV2,\n  calculateMultiSlotAvailability as universalCalculateMultiSlotAvailability,\n  getScheduleAvailability as universalGetScheduleAvailability,\n  queryAvailability as universalQueryAvailability,\n} from './bookings-availability-v1-slot-availability-availability-calendar.universal.js';\n\nexport const __metadata = { PACKAGE_NAME: '@wix/bookings' };\n\nexport function queryAvailability(\n  httpClient: HttpClient\n): QueryAvailabilitySignature {\n  return (\n    query: NonNullablePaths<QueryV2, `filter`, 2>,\n    options?: QueryAvailabilityOptions\n  ) =>\n    universalQueryAvailability(\n      query,\n      options,\n      // @ts-ignore\n      { httpClient }\n    );\n}\n\ninterface QueryAvailabilitySignature {\n  /**\n   * Retrieves appointment slots or class events that match specified filters.\n   *\n   * <blockquote>\n   *\n   * Query Availability doesn't use a query builder, instead it uses\n   * [API query language](https://dev.wix.com/docs/sdk/articles/work-with-the-sdk/api-query-language).\n   *\n   * </blockquote>\n   *\n   * ## Course limitations\n   *\n   * Course events can't be retrieved with this method.
